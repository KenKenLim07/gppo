## Firebase Data Structure

When emergency is triggered, the following fields are updated in `users/{uid}`:

```json
{
  "status": "Emergency",
  "emergencyTriggeredAt": 1703123456789,
  "lastUpdated": 1703123456789
}
```

When emergency is cleared:

```json
{
  "status": "Active",
  "emergencyTriggeredAt": null,
  "lastUpdated": 1703123456789
}
```

3. The button will show loading, then change to a checkmark
4. Emergency status is now active and visible to command center
5. Tap the checkmark to manually clear, or wait 30 seconds for auto-clear

## Security Considerations
- Emergency status is tied to authenticated user UID
- Status updates are logged with timestamps
- No additional confirmation required for quick response
- Auto-reset prevents false alarms from persisting

## Future Enhancements
- Audio alerts for command center
- Push notifications for emergency triggers
- Emergency response workflow integration
- Historical emergency event logging
- Emergency contact notifications
